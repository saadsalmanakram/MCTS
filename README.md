## 📝 Introduction  

**Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** is a powerful search algorithm used in **AI-driven decision-making**, particularly in **game-playing, robotics, and planning problems**. This repository serves as a **complete guide** to understanding, implementing, and optimizing MCTS in **Python** with real-world examples.  

📌 **Understand the fundamentals of MCTS**  
📌 **Explore the four key MCTS steps: Selection, Expansion, Simulation, Backpropagation**  
📌 **Implement MCTS from scratch in Python**  
📌 **Apply MCTS to board games like Chess, Go, and Tic-Tac-Toe**  
📌 **Optimize MCTS using parallelization & deep learning**

## 🚀 Example Code  

### 🎲 **Basic MCTS Node Implementation**  
```python
import math
import random

class Node:
    def __init__(self, state, parent=None):
        self.state = state
        self.parent = parent
        self.children = []
        self.visits = 0
        self.value = 0.0

    def select_best_child(self):
        return max(self.children, key=lambda child: child.value / (child.visits + 1e-6) + math.sqrt(2 * math.log(self.visits + 1) / (child.visits + 1)))

    def expand(self):
        new_state = self.state.get_next_state()  # Define this in your game logic
        child = Node(new_state, parent=self)
        self.children.append(child)
        return child
```

### 🎲 **MCTS Algorithm Implementation**  
```python
def mcts_search(root, iterations=1000):
    for _ in range(iterations):
        node = root
        while node.children:
            node = node.select_best_child()
        new_node = node.expand()
        reward = simulate(new_node.state)  # Run a Monte Carlo simulation
        backpropagate(new_node, reward)
    return max(root.children, key=lambda child: child.visits)

def backpropagate(node, reward):
    while node:
        node.visits += 1
        node.value += reward
        node = node.parent
```

### 🎲 **MCTS for Tic-Tac-Toe**  
```python
from tic_tac_toe import TicTacToe  # Assume TicTacToe class is defined

game = TicTacToe()
root = Node(game)
best_move = mcts_search(root, iterations=500)
print("Best Move:", best_move.state)
```
