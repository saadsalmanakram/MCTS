(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

4- What is the purpose of the Selection step in MCTS?

Ans- The Selection step involves traversing the tree from the root node to select the most promising child node using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) formula.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

5- What happens during the Expansion step of MCTS?

Ans- A new child node is added to the tree at the node selected during the Selection step.
