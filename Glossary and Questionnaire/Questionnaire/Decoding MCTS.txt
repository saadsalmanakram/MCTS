1- What is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)?

Ans- MCTS is a heuristic search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo methods with tree-based search techniques to handle complex decision-making and game-playing scenarios.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

2- How does MCTS differ from traditional search algorithms?

Ans- Unlike traditional algorithms that exhaustively explore the search space, MCTS uses random sampling and statistical evaluation to focus on promising areas of the search space.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

3- What are the four key steps in MCTS?

Ans- Selection, Expansion, Simulation, and Backpropagation.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

4- What is the purpose of the Selection step in MCTS?

Ans- The Selection step involves traversing the tree from the root node to select the most promising child node using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) formula.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

5- What happens during the Expansion step of MCTS?

Ans- A new child node is added to the tree at the node selected during the Selection step.
