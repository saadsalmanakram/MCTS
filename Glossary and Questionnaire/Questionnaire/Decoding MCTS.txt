1- What is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)?

Ans- MCTS is a heuristic search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo methods with tree-based search techniques to handle complex decision-making and game-playing scenarios.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

2- How does MCTS differ from traditional search algorithms?

Ans- Unlike traditional algorithms that exhaustively explore the search space, MCTS uses random sampling and statistical evaluation to focus on promising areas of the search space.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

3- What are the four key steps in MCTS?

Ans- Selection, Expansion, Simulation, and Backpropagation.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

4- What is the purpose of the Selection step in MCTS?

Ans- The Selection step involves traversing the tree from the root node to select the most promising child node using the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) formula.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

5- What happens during the Expansion step of MCTS?

Ans- A new child node is added to the tree at the node selected during the Selection step.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

6- Describe the Simulation step in MCTS.

Ans- The Simulation step involves running random plays from the newly added node until a terminal state or predefined depth is reached.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

7- What is Backpropagation in MCTS?

Ans- Backpropagation updates the nodes along the path from the newly added node to the root with the results of the simulation, including visit counts and win ratios.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

8- What role does the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) formula play in MCTS?

Ans- The UCB formula helps balance exploration and exploitation by evaluating nodes based on both their empirical mean and the number of visits.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

9- Why is MCTS particularly useful for games with large search spaces?

Ans- MCTS effectively explores large and complex search spaces without requiring exhaustive exploration, making it suitable for strategic games with vast possibilities.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

10- How does MCTS handle games with imperfect or unknown information?

Ans- MCTS relies on statistical sampling rather than complete knowledge, making it adaptable to scenarios with incomplete information.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

11- What is the exploration-exploitation trade-off in MCTS?

Ans- Itâ€™s the balance between exploring new and potentially better moves and exploiting known promising moves to optimize decision-making.

(-------------------------------------------------------------------------)

12- What are some advantages of using MCTS?

Ans- MCTS can handle complex games, adapt to imperfect information, learn from simulations, and is scalable and parallelizable.
